            <h6>Burn</h6>
            <p>There's not actually any part of my body apart from my face that is normal.

My burns start from the top of my neck all the way down to the top of my bottom, and then around the front of my stomach and down my left leg. And then on the rest of my body I've got lots of little pinprick holes all down my arms and my legs from where they took skin.</p>

            <h6>Stores</h6>
            <p>"No, I'm just looking." Words most of us have said when approached politely by a sales assistant while browsing in a shop. Most of us will not have then experienced the sales assistant snarling: "Then 'op it, mate!"

Hearing those words in a London shop made quite an impression on Harry Gordon Selfridge.
